# Implementing Draggable and Droppable in JavaScript

Look through the code and see what is there. The core work to be done is within the `code.js` file.

Your job is to implement drag and droppable targets.

The drag targets should be draggable around the page.

The drop targets activate when you attempt to drop a drag target within the drop target. Dropping a drag element into a drop element will cause the drag element to be enclosed by the drop element.

When a drag target is hovering over a drop target, highlight the drop target (simple CSS is provided for this).

You may change existing code to fit your needs, although you should only need to add code (changing is not a requirement).

A particular solution is in the solution folder.
