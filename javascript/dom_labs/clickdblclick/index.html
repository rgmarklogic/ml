/**
 * A function that correctly applies a click and dblclick event to
 * an element, and that differentiates clicks from dblclicks.
 * Rules:
 * Have closure variables keep timings to detect when the first click
 * happened.
 * Set a timeout of some kind that fires a normal click event if a
 * second click doesn't happen in 300ms.
 * Fire a dblclick if the second click arrives before 300ms.
 * @param el {DOMElement} The element to listen for click and double
 * click events.
 * @param [click] {Function} Optional click listener. Listener
 * will be called with el as the this arg and will be passed the
 * event object of the click.
 * @param [dblclick] {Function} Optional dblclick listener. Listener
 * will be called with el as the this arg and will be passed the
 * event object of the click.
 */

/*
 * TODO: Apply the function you made above to the target and
 * turn the background red on a click and green on a dblclick.
