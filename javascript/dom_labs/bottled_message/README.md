# Message in a bottle

Build a page with a form that takes a message from a user.

When the user submits the form, have the message appear at the bottom of the page, and float to the top of the page.

Bonus points for enclosing the message in something that looks like a bottle.

Remove the message (and any bottle HTML) after it passes out of the top of the page.
