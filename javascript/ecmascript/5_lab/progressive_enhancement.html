/*
 * TODO #1:
 * Progressively enhance your JavaScript experience by implementing a
 * more robust (and more correct) ECMAScript 5 Array.prototype.forEach method.
 *
 * The Array.prototype.forEach method has the following signature:
 *
 *     Array.prototype.forEach = function(callback, thisArg) { ... };
 *
 * Where:
 *     -> callback {function} the callback function to call on each element of
 *        the array.
 *     -> thisArg {object} if supplied, this object is used as the calling
 *        context of the callback function.
 *
 * Procedures and checks to implement:
 *     -> if callback is not callable (e.g. is not a function), throw a
 *        TypeError.
 *     -> if the callback is callable, it receives the following parameters
 *
 *        callback(arrayElement, currentIndex, arrayReference)
 *
 *        Where:
 *            -> arrayElement {mixed} Reference to the current array element
 *               being iterated over.
 *            -> currentIndex {Number} Integer index value of the current
 *               array element being iterated over.
 *            -> arrayReference {Array} A reference to the array being
 *               iterated over.
 *
 *        Additionally, if the thisArg is provided, set it as the calling
 *        context of each call to the callback function.
 *        (Hint: Look up the Function methods .call() and .apply() if you
 *        are not familiar with them.)
 */



/*
 * TODO #2:
 * We need to be aware of one caveat when modifying the prototype of
 * Functions and native types. The following test is easier to see in
 * modern and old browsers alike.
 *
 * Implement a .devnull() noop method on the Object.prototype.
 */



/*
 * TODO #3:
 * Run the following test:
 *
 *     -> Build an object.
 *     -> Iterate the object in a for-in loop.
 *     -> Note the properties that show up.
 *
 * How can we prevent prototype added properties from showing up in a for-in
 * loop? What is the consequence of preventing prototype properties from
 * showing up in our for-in loops? (hint, look up the hasOwnProperty method
 * and see how to implement as a protection for objects we iterate over.)
