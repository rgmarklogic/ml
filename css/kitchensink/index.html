    Each HTML document should have one html tag enclosing everything.
    
    Each tag can have attributes. We are declaring that our page is in
    English. See:

<html lang="en">
    <!--
        Every HTML document can and should have one head tag, after html
        and before body.

    <head>

            Declare the encoding of this file. It's more important that 
            the server declares the encoding correctly in the HTTP Headers 
            and that the file is saved using that encoding.
            
            I often use UTF-8, and make my editors do the same. See:
            
                http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utf-8
                
            Note about different tags or elements. See:
            
                http://www.w3.org/TR/html-markup/syntax.html#syntax-elements

            In summary, there are essentially two kinds of elements that we'll
            use: void elements and non-void elements.
            
            Head is an example of a non-void element, and it will always
            have a start and end tag, like so:
            
                <head>
                    ...stuff goes here...
                </head>
            
            The meta tag, like the one we have below, is a void element.
            It never has an end tag, it will only have a start tag.
            Void elements, like img, meta, hr, br, etc... can be written
            in the following ways:
            
                <meta charset="UTF-8">
            
            or
            
                <meta charset="UTF-8"/>
            
            The first way is a void tag valid in HTML. The
            second is a self-closing tag, valid for HTML XML parsers. 
            Browsers don't actually care how you style your tags 
            nowadays. I am a bit old school, and have bizarre reasons 
            for using a self-closing tag, but don't worry, you don't
            have to.

            CSS files can be linked or embedded. In general, it is better to
            link CSS files. This costs us 1 HTTP request but the potential
            benefits are well summarized here:
            
                http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html
                
            The rel attribute is important. Do not leave it off.
            
            This CSS file is a third party file to normalize cross browser
            differences. See:
            
                http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/
            
            Compiled code writers have always had cross platform porting
            to worry about (e.g. making Windows code run on OS X).
            Web page developers have to "port" code between different
            browsers. As time marches on, making a web page compatible
            across browsers is getting easier, but probably will never
            disappear entirely.
            
            There are different ways to normalize and reset the CSS
            rules across different browsers. I prefer what normalize.css
            does, and I also like that I can include their code and
            not have to write it from scratch. Sharing is caring.
            
            This file contains no additional comments as I will not modify
            it from the original source code.

            An additional CSS file that contains the styling specific to
            our page. This style is developed by us for our own needs.
            
            Your page can have as many CSS files as you wish to place in
            it (however, remember HTTP requests are "expensive" in terms
            of performance, it's best to not make too many of them if
            you can avoid it).
            
            In real life, I would probably combine these two CSS files into
            one CSS file to cut down on the number of HTTP requests required
            to get our code. For this example, I will keep the files
            separate to make it easier for me to update the example.

                <h1>What is Books &amp; Beyond?</h1>
                <p>
                    Some say it's a bookstore. Some call it a music shop, while others think of it as a great place to meet and relax. Books &amp; Beyond has become a unique phenomenon that offers this area's largest selection of sale books and music, with an inventory of CDs and tapes ranging from classical to independent-label rock and everything in between.

                    What makes us different is our atmosphere. We encourage you to relax with a book in one of our quiet rooms, or take some reading material into our Coffee and Juice Bar to read while snacking. Think of Books &amp; Beyond as your own den.

                This comment between the sections is purposeful to remove
                the effective white space. This is due to the fact I'll
                be using inline-blocks for styling these columns.

                <h1>Why go to any other book store?</h1>
                <p>
                    Need some quiet time away from your home or office? Need to put the speed and chaos of modern life in the backseat for a while? Sometimes, a little solitude buried in the pages of a good book is all you'll need. Visit with a friend over a super large double cappuccino or a fruit smoothie. Take a break from the everyday routine and pick up one of our award-winning desserts. You can do all these things at Books &amp; Beyond.
